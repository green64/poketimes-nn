# My First Redux Project

## Description

I'm exploring ways to automate my blog, and I've come across several React methods. But it had been six months since I tackled anything new in React, and I needed a refresher. I really like The Net Ninja on YouTube, so I decided to give his [Complete React Tutorial & Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIDLw0M-m0) a whirl. 

## Technologies Used

As you might guess, this project uses React and Redux. At first the data came from Axios, but once I added the Redux store I redirected the code. Babel is used, too, for compiling, and I think that's about it. 

## Project Link

I'm now hosting my site on GoDaddy, and I've been unsuccessful in getting it deployed there. BUT ... my friend and fellow developer Patrick Kearny is hosting his site there too, and he's got his running! Next step: deployment. Then I'll tackle Sitepoint's Build Your First React Blog tutorial, which I hope will help me automate my ever-growing Fresh Perspective blog.
