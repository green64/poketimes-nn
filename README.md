# My First Redux Project
[My First Redux Project](https://murmuring-lake-30920.herokuapp.com/)


## Description

I'm exploring ways to automate my blog, and I've come across several React methods. But it had been six months since I tackled anything new in React, and I needed a refresher. I really like The Net Ninja on YouTube, so I decided to give his [Complete React Tutorial & Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIDLw0M-m0) a whirl. 

This app isn't much to look at, and it doesn't "do" much. But it's an important Phase I step toward automating my blog with React. 

## Technologies Used

As you might guess, this project uses React and Redux. At first the data came from Axios, but once I added the Redux store I redirected the code. Babel is used, too, for compiling, and I think that's about it. 

## Heroku Hosting

This project gave me the opportunity to experiment with Redux. It also provided another chance to practice deployment. I wasn't able to get the app to function on GoDaddy where my site is hosted. But I did successfully deploy it to Heroku. 

The next React app I build is designed to work with Firebase, which will no doubt provide new deployment challenges. I can't wait!
